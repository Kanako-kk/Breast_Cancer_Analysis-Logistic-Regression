# Breast Cancer Analysis and Logistic Regression
 
"Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world. It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area.

The key challenges against itâ€™s detection is how to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign(non cancerous). We ask you to complete the analysis of classifying these tumors using machine learning (with SVMs) and the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset."

In the code markdown, I have
1, Created a logistic regression model (accuracy=97.1%) using scikit-learn in python, predicting whether the tumor is malignant or benign based on features such as area, symmetry, smoothness, etc.
2, Plotted heat map and histograms of tumor features and their correlation with tumor diagnosis.
